# Exertify - Windows Mobile app

The motivation behind this project was to track my workout progress more easily using my smartphone.

* The app uses an exercise database and keeps track of the user's fitness level
* The database is stored in JSON format - the main principles of serialization and deserialization are applied
* Images of how each exercise should be executed are displayed in the app. Includes motivational posters as well
